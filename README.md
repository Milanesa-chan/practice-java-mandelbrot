# Practice Java Mandelbrot

A Mandelbrot Set visualizer that I made in Java as a practice project.

### Controls

**- Move:** Mouse drag / W, A, S, D

**- Zoom:** Mouse wheel / Q, E, Arrow up, Arrow down

**- Change iterations:** R, F

*(Use this when you reach a point where lines seem "smooth". It "creates" more fractals.)*

**- Change resolution scaling:** T, G

*(Reducing resolution scaling improves performance substantially.)*

Play with both parameters to get the best balance between performance/looks. Plan on adding a dynamic adjuster :P
